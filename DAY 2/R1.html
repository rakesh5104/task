<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>I recently visited Friends Restaurant and tried their Veg Mixed Fried Rice. I must say, it was delicious! The rice was perfectly cooked and the vegetables were fresh and flavorful. The portion size was generous and the pricing was reasonable. Overall, I highly recommend this dish at Friends Restaurant for all the vegetarian food lovers out there. Can't wait to try their other dishes soon!</p>
